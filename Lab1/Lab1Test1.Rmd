## Intro
The dataset *Hollywoood Movies* is from the Lock5Data package.  It provides data on movies from Hollywood that were released between the years of 2007 and 2013.  Some of the variables included are *Movie* -title of the movie, *RottenTomatoes* - the Rotten Tomatoes score, and *Genre* - the genre of the movie.  

```{r}
 movieDataset <- HollywoodMovies
head(movieDataset)
```

## Summary of Data

```{r echo=FALSE}
(yearMade <- summary(HollywoodMovies$Year))
(projectBudget <- summary(HollywoodMovies$Budget))
(RTScore <- summary(HollywoodMovies$RottenTomatoes))
yearMean <- mean(HollywoodMovies$Year)
```
The three variables that I thought would be the most useful are Year - the year the movies were made, Budget- the budget for the movie, RottenTomatoes- the Rotten Tomatoes score for the movie.  The summaries for these variables are being displayed in that order.  

The average year for the HollywoodMovies dataset is `yearMean` .

## Data Analysis

```{r}
xyplot(AudienceScore ~ RottenTomatoes, data = HollywoodMovies)
xyplot(WorldGross ~ OpeningWeekend, data = HollywoodMovies)
```


## Conclusion
In the first graph, the audience score is being compared to the Rotten Tomatoes score, to see if theres any type of correlation.  And it seems like there is a mild positive correlation between the audience score and the Rotten Tomatoes score.  

The second graph compares world gross (the gross income for all viewers) and the opening weekend gross, both in millions of dollars.  and there appears to be a strong positive correlation between the two.
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
